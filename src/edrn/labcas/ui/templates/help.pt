                <p>LabCAS ("Laboratory Catalog and Archive Services") is a
        web-enabled environment that allows users to publish, share, search
        and download a wide variety of biomedical datasets. This page contains
        information for end-users of the LabCAS portal and services. </p>
                <h1 id="LabCASUserGuide-DataPublishing">Data Publishing</h1>
                <p>At present,
        data can be published into LabCAS in two possible ways: by using the
        LabCAS User Interface to upload and trigger ingestion of data; or by
        uploading data directly to the LabCAS server. Before publishing, data
        should be "curated" i.e. organized in a meaningful directory
        structure, and provided with enough metadata to make them useful to
        other users.</p>
                <h2 id="LabCASUserGuide-DataStructure">Data
        Structure</h2>
                <p>Data in LabCAS is organized according to the
        following logical hierarchy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collections</strong>:
        broad sets of related data from the same study, the same analysis, or
        the same project. </li>
                    <li><strong>Datasets</strong>: different sets
        of related files within the same collection - for example, the
        different patients of a clinical study, or the different labs
        participating in a study.</li>
                    <li><strong>Files</strong>: all the
        files in a given dataset - for example, all the images for a single
        patient, or all the data supplied by a single
        lab.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collection=RNA Sequencing,
        Dataset=ERR164773, Files=ERR164773_1.fastq, ERR164773_2.fastq,
        gene.counts</li>
                    <li>Collection=University of Colorado Lung Images,
        Dataset=UCHSC_1467, Files=<span>22021 P06-32 B4 Bronchus Intermedium
        x40 D1.jpg</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before publishing data into LabCAS, you
        should organize them in a meaningful directory structure conforming to
        the model above.</p>
                <h2 id="LabCASUserGuide-         Metadata">Metadata</h2>
                <p>In LabCAS, metadata can be associated to
        data at all 3 levels: collections, datasets, and files. When
        publishing, it is recommended that the following metadata fields be
        supplied to make the data searchable and more useful (mandatory fields
        are <u>underlined</u>). When using the LabCAS UI to publish data, some
        of these fields are automatically populated based on the user login,
        or the value of other supplied fields.</p>

                <h2 id="LabCASUserGuide-         PublishingviaLabCASUI">Publishing via LabCAS UI</h2>
                <p>The LabCAS web
        portal provides a web-enabled
        workflow for uploading data to the server, and trigger publication to
        the LabCAS archive. The user is guided through the process of
        selecting the files from their own desktop, and populating the
        required and recommended metadata fields. Because uploading data
        through the browser is not very efficient, this process is recommended
        for datasets that are not very large (up to a few GB in size).</p>
                <h2 id="LabCASUserGuide-UploadingDatatotheLabCASServer">Uploading Data to
        the LabCAS Server</h2>
                <p>Very large datasets should be transferred to
        the LabCAS server via some means other than a web browser. At this
        time, LabCAS offers two ways to upload data directly: SFTP and WebDAV.
        Both protocols are supported on a variety of platforms including
        Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. Before uploading data, please make sure
        to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organize your data in a directory structure
        corresponding to one collection and one or more datasets, as described
        above</li>
                    <li>For each dataset, provide as much metadata as possible
        in a file colocated with the dataset, and named &lt;dataset&gt;.cfg
        </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then proceed through one of the two methods
        below.</p>
                <h3 id="LabCASUserGuide-SFTP">SFTP</h3>
                <p>In this section we
        describe how to upload data using a Unix-like system (macOS, Linux,
        FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.) and on Windows.</p>
                <h4 id="LabCASUserGuide-         Unix">Unix</h4>
                <p>On Unix-like systems, do the
        following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generate a public/private RSA key pair with the
        following command, or use an existing pair if you have one:<ul><li>ssh
        -keygen -t rsa</li></ul></li>
                    <li>Send your public key (id_rsa.pub) to
        the LabCAS team so they can enter it in the list of allowed user
        keys</li>
                    <li>Simply use the SFTP client of your choice to connect to
        the LabCAS server (with no username or password, since authentication
        is provided by the key), navigate to your assigned root directory,
        create new directories for the Collection and Dataset to upload, then
        transfer the data (all files in the current local directory, including
        the metadata file &lt;dataset&gt;.cfg):<ul><li><p class="p1"><span class="s1">sftp <a href="mailto:sftpxfer@zipper.jpl.nasa.gov" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">sftpxfer@zipper.jpl.nasa.gov</a></span></p></li><li><p class="p1">cd data/&lt;user directory&gt;</p></li><li>mkdir

                </ul>
                <h4 id="LabCASUserGuide-Windows">Windows</h4>
                <p>On Windows systems, you
        first generate a public/private key pair:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Download and
        install both <a href="http://www.putty.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">PuTTY</a> and <a href="https://winscp.net/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">WinSCP</a>. Both are free, open-source
        software packages.</li>
                    <li>Installing PuTTY makes a new program
        available, PuTTYgen. Start this.</li>
                    <li>At the bottom, select SSH-2
        RSA and enter 2048 bits. (This should be the default.)</li>
                    <li>Press
        "Generate".</li>
                    <li>Move the mouse around in the blank area
        to generate random numbers until the progress bar is
        filled.</li>
                    <li>Click "Save public key" and save the key to
        a file. Mail that file to JPL and we'll install it in the right place.
        Alternatively, you can click in the Public key box, select ALL the
        text, and paste that in an email. This key should be a single long
        line of text that starts with "ssh-rsa AAAA…"</li>
                    <li>Enter
        a passphrase (and confirm it) then press "Save private key".
        Choose a filename (say "LabCAS") and save it to your
        Documents folder.</li>
                    <li>Close PuTTYgen.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>At this point,
        you'll need to await confirmation from JPL that your public key has
        been installed. Once you hear back, you can start uploading data with
        the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open WinSCP.</li>
                    <li>Press the
        "Advanced" button.</li>
                    <li>On the left side, under
        "SSH", click "Authentication".</li>
                    <li>Under
        "Authentication parameters", click the ellipsis … button
        under "Private key file".</li>
                    <li>Select the private key you
        saved in the Documents folder in step 7 (above). Click
        "OK".</li>
                    <li>Under "Session", select SFTP. For
        Host name, enter zipper-vm.jpl.nasa.gov; for user name, enter
        "sftpxfer".</li>
                    <li>You will be warned the first time you're
        connecting to an unknown server. Press the "Copy Key"
        button. Then press "Yes".</li>
                    <li>Enter the passphrase for
        the private key you created in step 7 (above). Check the box by
        "Remember password for this session". Then press
        "OK".</li>
                    <li>You now have a window on the left with your
        local files and on the right. To send a file, select it on the left
        and click "Upload". Or simply drag and drop. You'll be
        prompted the first time to set up transfer settings. The defaults are
        fine, so check "Do not show this dialog box again" and press
        "OK".</li>
                </ol>
